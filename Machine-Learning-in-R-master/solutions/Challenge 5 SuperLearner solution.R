### Big question 5 answer: ensemble methods like SuperLearner spare us the pain of incorrectly choosing a single and inappropriate algorithm. Not only do we get the single best performing algorithm (the "discrete winner"), but we are also provided with the weighted ensemble average of all the algorithms. This is in addition to comparisons of cross-validated risk for the individual learners. Furthermore, for a real project it would be ideal to create 5, 10, or 50 tuned versions of the same algorithm for comparison not only against different algorithms, but also against other tuned versions of iteslef. We can also create custom algorithms to include in our ensemble.
